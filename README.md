The library uses invoked Ajax or script tags marked with the class "tjs-script-include" and downloads them from the src or if marked with class "tjs-script-execute" and needs to get a unique id so the queue can keep track on it use a data-tjs-pid attribute and data-tjs-priority for setting its order inside the array. Take extra care since conflicting pid`s may overwrite a running thread. And the same applies to the queue conflicting priority is overwriten with the last one passed unles the option no-queue-override is set in the object instantiation then the index is summed up 1 until its reaches a free position obs: this option is not recomended.
note: to prevent the browser from running the javascript set its type as anything not "text/javascript".
